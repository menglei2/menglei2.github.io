### [Project 1: Body Type Prediction](https://github.com/menglei2/Body_Type_Prediction)

As human, we are all attracted to people’s look. And people have strong preferences on body type. Therefore, we are interested to see how body type is displayed in the dataset and its relationship with other variables. Besides, we also want to predict body type using the other variables, for example, diet, drinks, etc..

The dataset contains user profiles from the dating site [OkCupid.com](okcupid.com). The users are all based in San Francisco, California beginning in June 2012. The columns include demographics and user answers and they are used for others to see on their profile page. The original source is [“OkCupid Data for Introductory Statistics and Data Science Courses”](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10691898.2015.11889737#) by Albert Kim and Adriana Escobedo-Land. 


### [Project 2: SBA Small Business Loan Analysis](https://github.com/menglei2/SBA_Small_Loan_Analysis)

The purpose of this analysis is to find out what are the significant factors that lead to default in the state of Illinois. We use the SBA Loans dataset to find out those factors. In this report, we focus on seven predictors that we think are significant to predict the loan status. We use descriptive statistics, data visualization, and logistic regression to get a brief idea about the related factors.


### [Project 3: Wine Review Analysis](https://github.com/menglei2/Wine_Review_Analysis)

This project uses wine review dataset at Kaggle to predictthe points rated by WineEnthusiast on a scale of 1-100 based on several wine information, including wine review, country of the wine, variety and winery. Two models are used: linear regression and random forest regression. Exploratory data analysis is also included.
